% Acknowledgments
\acknowledgments{
    For me, this journey has been longer and more complex than anyone could have ever imagined. First and foremost, I'd like to express my deepest gratitude to my family â€” my mom, dad, and brother. I couldn't have reached this point without your unwavering support.
    
I must also extend my heartfelt thanks to my advisor, Professor Lorena Barba. Her introduction to Almadena Chtchelkanova solidified my decision to complete my work in the U.S. under her guidance. I am immensely grateful for her support throughout my time at George Washington University.

I also owe a debt of gratitude to Professor Thomas Lichtenegger. His support at the PFM lab significantly enhanced the computational aspect of my research, and I gained invaluable insights from our meetings.

Special acknowledgment goes to Zephra Coles, the Department Operations Lead. Her outstanding management skills have made my paperwork at GWU far more manageable.

I want to extend my thanks to my lab mates: Paulina Rodriguez, Ting-Gyu Wang, Olivier Mesnard, Natalia Clementi, and Pi-Yueh Chang.
Further thanks go to researchers Leonid Tonkov, Alena Chernova, and Alexander Novikov. Their expertise and support were invaluable as I embarked on my research journey.

Last but not least, I want to thank my partner, Lawrence Kirk, your emotional and intellectual support has been my rock. My Russian-speaking graduate friends, Anna Medvedeva, Maria Sidulova, and Anna Webber. Your support has made my journey in a foreign country significantly smoother.

% Some abstract text
\abstract{
Landslides, causing over 5000 deaths annually, not only represent a tragic loss of life but also bring devastating economic consequences. With increasing flood frequency and severity exacerbated by drought and global warming, understanding and predicting landslides involving granular media, water, and the air is crucial. Our research aims to study the interaction of particles, rocks, and boulders with water.

For simulations, we use CFD methods combined with the Discrete Element Method (DEM) to represent solid bodies of arbitrary shapes. To improve the simulation model, we developed a force model based on the open-source code CFDEMcoupling\cite{kloss2012models}. We use a resolved CFD-DEM approach, where the solid body takes more than a computational cell. This simulation helps to track interactions between fluids and solids, such as the movement of soil or rocks falling into water.

The fluid and solid components are discretized using the Eulerian and Lagrangian frameworks. The solid component is coupled using the Immersed Boundary Method, where a solid body projects into the CFD mesh. For the free surface simulation in the current work, we use the geometric reconstruction method based on isoAdvector solver \cite{roenby2019isoadvector} and the DEM for solid body simulation. Validation and verification showed that the solver performs according to our expectations. We conducted more detailed simulations based on those initial results, including a bouncing body test, demonstrating the method's stability and reliability. Then, we ran the simulation with multispherical body interactions and two-phase fluids, showing that the method could effectively handle complex interactions between solid and liquid phases and the dynamics of multiple solid bodies. It can track the motion and interaction of bodies with non-uniform shapes through the fluid, which involves complex boundary conditions and potentially non-linear material behavior. Results also show that the solver is effective for parallel computations by the decreased computation times with increased processor counts. We provide the solver's documentation online, and a container application ensures reproducibility. 

This advanced computational capability, demonstrated by our solver, is crucial for accurately modeling and understanding real-world phenomena such as landslides, sediment transport, and various particulate flow problems, thereby contributing significantly to computational fluid dynamics and disaster risk management.
