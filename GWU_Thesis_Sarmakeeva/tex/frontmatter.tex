% Acknowledgments
\acknowledgments{
    For me, this journey has been longer and more complex than anyone could have ever imagined. First and foremost, I'd like to express my deepest gratitude to my family â€” my mom, dad, and brother. I couldn't have reached this point without your unwavering support.
    
I must also extend my heartfelt thanks to my advisor, Professor Lorena Barba. Her introduction to Almadena Chtchelkanova solidified my decision to complete my work in the U.S. under her guidance. I am immensely grateful for her support throughout my time at George Washington University.

I also owe a debt of gratitude to Professor Thomas Lichtenegger. His support at the PFM lab significantly enhanced the computational aspect of my research, and I gained invaluable insights from our meetings.

Special acknowledgment goes to Zephra Coles, the Department Operations Lead. Her outstanding management skills have made my paperwork at GWU far more manageable.

I want to extend my thanks to my lab mates: Paulina Rodriguez, Ting-Gyu Wang, Olivier Mesnard, Natalia Clementi, and Pi-Yueh Chang.
Further thanks go to researchers Leonid Tonkov, Alena Chernova, and Alexander Novikov. Their expertise and support were invaluable as I embarked on my research journey.

Last but not least, I want to thank my partner, Lawrence Kirk, your emotional and intellectual support has been my rock. My Russian-speaking graduate friends, Anna Medvedeva, Maria Sidulova, and Anna Webber. Your support has made my journey in a foreign country significantly smoother.
