For the sake of reproducibility, we published a setup for \href{https://github.com/asarmakeeva/multiphaseIB/tree/master/reproPack/code/cases}{computational cases}, which is available on GitHub \cite{github}. 

The folder contains two computational cases: sphere bouncing in two-phase fluid and multiple clumps interacting with two-phase fluid. These cases include information about initial conditions for CFD in folder \verb|/CFD/0| and for DEM in folder \verb|/DEM/in.liggghts_run|. They also include mesh generation \verb|/CFD/system/blockMeshDict| and mesh decomposition \verb|/CFD/system/decomposeParDict|. It also provides discretization schemes 
in a file \verb|/CFD/system/fvSchemes| and parameters for solving the system of algebraic equations \verb|/CFD/system/fvSolution|.

Folder \verb|forcemodels| includes \href{https://github.com/asarmakeeva/multiphaseIB/tree/master/reproPack/code/forcemodels}{force model} which was used for computations.

\href{https://github.com/asarmakeeva/multiphaseIB/tree/master/reproPack/code/solvers}{Solvers} includes folders \verb|cfdemSolverInterFlowIB| and \verb|cfdemSolverMultiphaseIB| with isoAdvector \cite{roenby2019isoadvector} and MULES \cite{MULES} methods for free surface reconstruction correspondingly.

In \href{https://github.com/asarmakeeva/multiphaseIB/tree/master/reproPack/postprocessing}{postprocessing} folder, we have two Jupyter notebooks for plots and postprocessing results to plot parallel efficiency and results for Richardson extrapolation. In the folder \verb|postprocessing/data| stored data, which was digitized from papers from cited experiments.

\href{https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/asarmakeeva/cfdem_ib/}{Docker container} is available at Dockerhub. It includes all initial setup for cases which we run for falling sphere, as well as cases for sinking clump and multiple clumps interacting with two-phase flow.
